  (Background)
  MariaDB packages bind MariaDB to 127.0.0.1 (the loopback IP address) by default as a security measure using 
  the bind-address configuration directive. Old MySQL packages sometimes disabled TCP/IP networking altogether using 
  the skip-networking directive. 
  Before going in to how to configure these, let's explain what each of them actually does:
  1) skip-networking is fairly simple. It just tells MariaDB to run without any of the TCP/IP networking options.
  2) bind-address requires a little bit of background information. A given server usually has at least two networking 
     interfaces (although this is not required) and can easily have more. The two most common are a Loopback network 
     device and a physical Network Interface Card (NIC) which allows you to communicate with the network. 
     MariaDB is bound to the loopback interface by default because it makes it impossible to connect to the TCP port 
     on the server from a remote host (the bind-address must refer to a local IP address, or you will receive a fatal error 
     and MariaDB will not start). This of course is not desirable if you want to use the TCP port from a remote host, so you 
     must remove this bind-address directive (MariaDB only supports one bind-address, but binds 
     to 0.0.0.0, or :: (every IP) if the bind-address directive is left out).
  
  step 1: Finding the defaults file
    Common locations for defaults files:
      * /etc/my.cnf                              (*nix/BSD)
      * $MYSQL_HOME/my.cnf                       (*nix/BSD) *Most Notably /etc/mysql/my.cnf
      * SYSCONFDIR/my.cnf                        (*nix/BSD)
      * DATADIR\my.ini                           (Windows)
      
  step 2: Editing the defaults file
    comment out these to lines:
      skip-networking
      ...
      bind-address = <some ip-address>
    to:
      #skip-networking
      ...
      #bind-address = <some ip-address>
      
  step 3: Grant user connections from remote host
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%.%.%.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'my-new-password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
    

::Start MySQL/MariaDB starts at boot:
    systemctl enable mariadb
